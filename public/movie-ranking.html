    <hr />

<h3>Queen Charlotte</h3>
<p>Beautiful settings, both clothings and scenery are magnificent. Choice of music is a top-notch!</p>
<h3>Spider Man: No Way Home</h3>
<p>Ngl, Tom Holland is my favorite actor in this century but the cross-over from the Multiverese is absolutely fantastic.</p>
<h3>John Wick</h3>
<p>The best action movie ever! Please watch all seasons especially the last one, Chapter 4. The last scene of duel was very satisfied.</p>
